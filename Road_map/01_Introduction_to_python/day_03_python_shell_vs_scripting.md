#Python Shell
- python shell is an interactive command line interface where we can type
python commands and get immediate feedback
- We can use for testing small snippets,experimenting or debugging.Also we can use the same in learning point of view
- it is good for quick calculation such as 
   
Example-print("Hello") => Hello
        2 + 3 => 5

# Python Scripting
- Writing a code in a file with the .py extension and run that file by using syntax
"python filename.py" in terminal
- Used for building program automation,data processing,web development etc
- it is good for reusable,complex tasks that don't require interaction
- Ex- a file hello.py containing a code 
   "print("Hello World")

# Major difference between Python Shell and Scripting
- Usage-Python shell is interactive and do line by line testing while python scripting run whole file
- Execution-Python shell gives immediate feedback while python scripting run whole script at once.
- Ideal for-Python shell is mostly used for experimentation and debugging while python scripting is used for building applications
- Persistence-Commands lost after exit while python script saved the code in file which can be reusable
